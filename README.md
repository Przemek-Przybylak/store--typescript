Store TypeScript

A dynamic e-commerce storefront built to master TypeScript integration in a React application.

DEMO: https://przemek-przybylak.github.io/store--typescript/

🚀 Project Overview

This is a sample online store where products are fetched dynamically from a mock API. Users can browse items, add them to a shopping cart, and remove items as needed. The primary goal of this project was to practice TypeScript in a React environment and understand type-safe state management.

🔧 Technologies & Tools

React 

TypeScript

Redux for state management

Redux-Saga for handling asynchronous actions

Styled-Components for CSS-in-JS styling

🎯 Key Features

Dynamic Product Fetching: Retrieves product data from an external (or mock) API on page load.

Shopping Cart: Add, update, and remove products with live cart state managed via Redux.

Asynchronous Flows: Utilizes Redux-Saga to handle side effects and API calls.

Type Safety: Interfaces and types everywhere to prevent runtime errors and improve developer experience.

Responsive Design: Simple layout that works on desktop and mobile screens.
